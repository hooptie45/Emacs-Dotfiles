<h1>A Guided Tour of an Implementation </h1>

<h1>of Clojure Destructuring Bind</h1>

<h2>in Emacs Lisp</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Clojure is a (relatively) new Lisp variant which has attracted a lot
of attention due to its modern features and close relationship with
the JVM.  Emacs Lisp is a lisp so antiquated that it attracts more
ridicule than plaudits.  This document is an attempt to bring some of
the nicer syntactical features from Clojure into Elisp.</p>

<p>Why?  I spend a lot of time in Emacs, which I use to organize notes,
experiment logs and to coordinate other programming languages.
Because I have limited opportunity to use other languages in my day to
day life, I like to implement features from other languages in Elisp
so that I get to use them on a daily basis.  In the same vein I've
implemented something similar to Clojure's multimethods, syntax for
monadic operation, many monads, lazy lists, and a stack-based
concatenative language inspired by Factor.  I'm currently working on
an implementation of Kanren, the logic language described in "The
Reasoned Schemer."  This archive includes just the projects described
here, but all my code is available on <a href="https://github.com/VincentToups/emacs-utils" title="Github">github</a>.</p>

<p>I've submitted this particular code because it represents several
months of work, demonstrates an auto-didactic streak which I think is
an important part of my personality, and also involves my interest in
functional programming languages and programming language theory and
design.  I also like this particular project because it demonstrates
how plucky even an old Lisp can be - we can import very modern
features into a lisp dialect which is quite old and crusty.  I'm not,
however, a Lisp zealot - I'm quite interested in working with other
functional languages.</p>

<h3>Running the Code</h3>

<p>This code requires GNU Emacs 23.1.1.  Extract the files located with
this readme to somewhere convenient.  Then start emacs with <code>emacs
-q</code>.  In the scratch buffer, execute:</p>

<pre><code>(add-to-list 'load-path &lt;Location/of/files/&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>You should then be able to <code>(require 'defn)</code> and execute the examples
in this document and/or play with the library.  Note that like most
other macro-heavy Elisp projects (like the partial Common Lisp
implementation) this library performs best when byte-compiled. </p>

<h3>Destructuring Bind</h3>

<p>Clojure owes a certain debt to the statically typed functional
languages.  It's emphasis on Lazy values calls to mind languages like
Haskell, and its destructuring bind forms refer to the pattern
matching (efficiently) afforded by static type systems like those in
Standard ML and its variants.  Destructuring bind has appeared in
dynamic languages like Lua and Python, where simple tuples can be
destructured, but Clojure's support is somewhat more extensive in that
it extends to generic destructuring of sequences and tables.  A few
examples will illustrate the facility.</p>

<p>In Scheme, for instance, we might wish to swap two numbers held in the
first and second slot of a list.</p>

<pre><code>(define (swap lst) 
 (list (cadr lst) (car lst)))
</code></pre>

<p>In Clojure we could specify how to extract values from the arguments
of a function right in the function definition:</p>

<pre><code>(defn swap [[a b]] (list a b))
</code></pre>

<p>(Clojure's binding forms are always literal vectors.)  Here <code>swap</code>
takes only one argument, but it binds two names.  The inner <code>[a b]</code>
expression indicates that the single argument is expected to be a
list, and that its first and second values should be bound to the
symbols <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> respectively.  Clojure's destructuring bind
supports recursive binding forms.  If, for instance, we wanted to
write a function which accepts a single list, whose second element is
a list, whose first value we wish to extract, we could write:</p>

<pre><code>(defn extract [[_ [a]]] a)
</code></pre>

<p>Where we have nested the destructuring deep into the sequence to pull
out <code>a</code>.  Error checking aside, this is a pretty nice feature,
particularly because Clojure <em>also</em> allows destructuring on tables,
which have their own source-level representation.  To write a function
which pulls out the values in a table located at keys <code>:x</code> and <code>:y</code>
and returns them in a flat list, we can write:</p>

<pre><code>(defn extract [{a :x b :y}] (list a b))
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose the value at <code>x</code> were a list and we wished to get its second
element:</p>

<pre><code>(defn extract [{[_ part] :x}] part)
</code></pre>

<p>Would do the trick.  We can combine, recursively, table and sequence
destructuring syntax.  This project is an implementation of this
feature in Emacs Lisp.</p>

<p>In short, Clojure's destructuring bind is a mini-language for
describing access to data structures.</p>

<h3>Bonus Material: Recur</h3>

<p>Tail call optimization is a controversial subject in some arenas.  The
feature was somewhat famously kept out of Python by its "dictator for
life."  Scheme implementations, on the other hand, are required to
support this feature.  More for reasons related to the JVM than any
political sensitivity, Clojure takes a middle path: tail calls to
"oneself" can be made by virtue of an explicit form, <code>recur</code>, which
resembles a function call but can only be invoked from tail position,
and which reuses the current stack frame instead of creating a new
one.  This allows many basic algorithms which depend on tail calls for
elegant expression to be written naturally in Clojure.</p>

<p>This library also allows the use of a <code>recur</code> special form, statically
checked to be only from tail position.  </p>

<h3>Syntactic &amp; Other Notes</h3>

<p>Clojure supports tables at the level of source code via a curly braces
notation:</p>

<pre><code>{:x 10 :y 11}
</code></pre>

<p>Would be the table with keys <code>:x</code>, <code>:y</code> pointing to 10 and 11
respectively.  Unfortunately, Emacs Lisp does not provide facilities
to extend the reader, which we could use to create a syntax for tables
if we were using (say) Common Lisp.  We'll be using a quasi-ad-hoc
solution instead.  My standard library provides functions to create
tables succinctly:</p>

<pre><code>(tbl! :x 10 :y 11)
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to the above Clojure.  For destructuring syntax we will
use a vector to represent sequences (<code>[a b c]</code>) and a vector with a
special head token to represent tables (<code>[:: a :x b :y]</code>).  That is,
<code>::</code> indicates an expression represents a table, rather than sequence
destructuring.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll allow the table syntax to destructure
association-lists, since these are common table surrogates in other
lisp dialects and because they can be made persistant (as data
structures) more easily than Emacs Lisp's tables.  This has no impact
on the syntax for destructuring bind, however.  </p>

<p>Finally, this implementation uses a few non-standard special forms
from my standard library which bear remarking upon.  The form
<code>let-seq</code>, defined in <code>utils.el</code> is a simple form for destructuring
lists.  It creates a context where a series of symbols are bound to
the values in a list:</p>

<pre><code>(let-seq (a b c) (list 3 2 1) 
  (list a b c))
</code></pre>

<p>Evaluates to '(1 2 3). </p>

<p>The form <code>let-tbl</code> allows a very simple form of table destructuring.  </p>

<pre><code>(let-tbl 
 ((x :a)
  (y :b))
 (tbl! :a 10 :b 11)
 (+ x y))
</code></pre>

<p>Evaluates to 21.</p>

<p>Both <code>let-seq</code> and <code>let-tbl</code> are used to parse the destructuring
syntax only.  Destructuring bind itself does not expand into them,
basically because destructuring can have recursive structures and
these forms are "flat".</p>

<p>The implementation makes use of other functions in the <code>utils.el</code>
library, but these are the most conspicuous departures from recognize-
able lisp.  </p>

<p>On a final note, Emacs Lisp is, by default, a dynamically scoped
language.  Functional programming depends a lot on closures (even your
ad asks "Do you think in closures?"), and so you'll see the
<code>lexical-let</code> form throughout the source code.  This is form from a
partial implementation of Common Lisp that ships with Emacs which
creates a lexical scope rather than a dynamic one.  Lexical scope is a
little more expensive than dynamic scope in Emacs, so you'll see this
form peppered throughout the code where necessary, rather than used
exclusively.</p>

<h3>Implementation Sketch</h3>

<p>Any destructuring bind expression will ultimately expand to a <code>let*</code>
form in Emacs Lisp.  Eg: </p>

<pre><code>(dlet [[x y] (list 1 2)]
   (+ x y))
</code></pre>

<p>Expands to something not unlike:</p>

<pre><code>(let* ((_ (list 1 2))
       (x (elt _ 0))
       (y (elt _ 1)))
    (+ x y))
</code></pre>

<p>(Where <code>_</code> in the actual expansion would be a fresh symbol for the
purposes of macro hygiene, probably generated with <code>gensym</code>.)</p>

<p>The task of this project is to parse the clojure-style forms and
convert them into a series of symbol/value pairs for a <code>let*</code>
expression.  </p>

<p>Two sub-parsers are defined in the files <code>parse-seq-binder.el</code> and
<code>parser-table-binder.el</code>, for sequences and tables respectively.
These parsers check and extract the syntax of their respective types,
but do not recursively parse sub-parts.  Recursive parsing is
supported at a higher level, essentially by trampolining.  </p>

<p>Both sub-parsers are ad-hoc parsers which fold series of state
dependent functions over the sequence of tokens representing the
binding expression.  Ultimately they return a list of important
information about each binding expression which allows the equivalent
pure emacs lisp <code>let</code> forms to be constructed.</p>

<p>The action of these parsers is coordinated in <code>defn.el</code>'s
<code>handle-binding</code> function which handles detecting which type of binder
needs to be interpreted and dispatching to the appropriate parser.
Recursive parsing of binding forms is supported at this level.  </p>

<p>Emacs Lisp enforces a max-nesting depth and so the slightly more
obvious strategy of creating nested-<code>let*</code>s is put aside in favor of
passing around an accumulator for the entire sequence of binding
pairs.  Hence, the functions <code>handle-binding</code>, <code>handle-tbl-binding</code>
and <code>handle-seq-bindind</code> sport an additional argument <code>previous-lets</code>
so that a list of <code>let*</code> binders can be collected.  There is much room
for optimization in this collection of of <code>let</code> forms, but since
macro-expansion is itself pretty expensive in Elisp for various
reasons, in practice we'll almost always compile code using
destructuring.  The Emacs Lisp byte compiler is capable of performing
these optimizations for us.</p>

<p>Once a sequence of symbol/value pairs is constructed, the rest of the
work of the macro is essentially bookkeeping.  <code>fn</code> is the form which
does most of the work, since <code>defn</code> expands in terms of <code>fn</code>.  The
body of the expanded <code>fn</code> is a lambda expression.  This expression
takes any number of arguments and checks this number against the
arities of the binders it was defined with.  If it finds a match, it
invokes the appropriate body - each body wrapped in a <code>let*</code> form whose
binding expressions were generated by parsing and expanding the
appropriate destructuring expression.  </p>

<p>The body of the function is expanded in slightly different ways
depending on whether the function tries to call itself recursively
using <code>recur</code>.</p>

<h4>Recur Implementation</h4>

<p>Tail recursion is similar to a loop in that it essentially indicates
that we re-execute a set of forms in a context where variables have
been bound to new values.  This library supports tail recursion by
using a codewalker to find and appropriately expand <code>recur</code> forms in
the body of a <code>recur</code> supporting form, enclosing the entire body in a
while loop.  An invisible loop sentinel controls whether we "recur"
when execution terminates or whether we rebind the appropriate
variables (using a <code>setq</code> expression) and execute the body again.</p>

<p>Because we are destructively updating the variables in our recursive
context, it is particularly important that we check whether <code>recur</code> is
invoked from tail position.  If we were to expand a <code>recur</code> form in
any context where there were subsequent expressions which depended on
the values in the scope, these expressions would behave anomalously.
Hence, we need a codewalker to <em>check</em> each occurrence of <code>recur</code> is
in tail position.  </p>

<p>Given an expression <code>expr</code>, a tail position is any position for which
there are no subsequent expressions to be evaluated.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>(progn a b c)
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, <code>c</code> is in tail position.  </p>

<pre><code>(progn a b (recur c))
</code></pre>

<p>would be a legal place for recur to occur, but:</p>

<pre><code>(progn (recur a) b c)
</code></pre>

<p>Would produce an error because <code>(recur a)</code> occurs before <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>
are evaluated.  In an <code>if</code> statement, <code>tail-ness</code> is preserved by
either branch of the statement.  So if an <code>if</code> statement is in tail
position, either branch is also in tail position, because they are
mutually exclusive.  Similar reasoning applies to <code>cond</code> and other
special forms.</p>

<p>The codewalker implemented in the second half of <code>defn.el</code> bears this
basic idea out, covering the entire bestiary of basic Emacs Lisp
forms.  Because Emacs Lisp is extensible via macros, our codewalker
cannot understand all possible un-expanded Emacs Lisp fragments.
Hencec this library calls <code>macroexpand-all</code> on code before it is
walked in order boil down any Elisp into a form containing only
primitive expressions.  The macro <code>dsetq</code> is then used to expand
<code>recur</code> into an expression which sets the local variables to their new
values.</p>

<p>If the codewalker detects a <code>recur</code> in non-tail position, it produces
an error.</p>

<h4>Note on Recur and Lexical Scope</h4>

<p>This version of recursion will not handle lexically scoped variables
completely correctly.  This is because it mutates the context of a
recursion without considering whether a <code>lambda</code> expression or other
artifact is hanging onto a reference to some value in that context.
Supporting the correct behavior would require a much more complex
codewalker, and, in any case the need is somewhat obviated by the
requirement that Emacs Lisp programmers explicitly indicate a desire
for lexical scope using a <code>lexical-let</code> expression.  Each
<code>lexical-let</code> then closes over its own version of the variables in
scope.  So even though we are employing mutation under the hood:</p>

<pre><code>(setq closures (dloop [i 0
                          acc nil]
                      (if (= i 10) (reverse acc)
                        (recur (+ i 1) 
                               (cons
                                (lexical-let ((x i))
                                  (lambda () x)) acc)))))
</code></pre>

<p>, which collects a series of <code>lambda</code>'s enclosing different values of
<code>i</code>, the following code produces the correct values:</p>

<pre><code>(funcall (elt closures 0)) -&gt; 0
(funcall (elt closures 4)) -&gt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Emacs Lisp will support real lexical scope in the next release of
emacs.  I'm pretty excited by this development, but I'm not sure how
it will impact these libraries.  Probably they should be completely
rewritten to exploit the new model of execution. </p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>

<p>Destructuring bind lets us construct some fairly concise
implementations of certain functions.  The function <code>prod,</code> which
takes a list and returns the product of its elements, might be
implemented with <code>(lambda (lst) (reduce #'* lst))</code>, of course, but it
makes a nice example:</p>

<pre><code>(require 'defn)
(defn prod
 ;;; prod will have two bodies, differentiated by arity
 ([[head &amp; tail :as list] acc]
  (if list (recur tail (* acc head)) acc))
 ([list]
  (prod list 1)))
</code></pre>

<p>This example demonstrates dispatch based on arity, destructuring of a
sequence (first argument, first body) and recursion.</p>

<pre><code>(prod '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)); -&gt; 5040
</code></pre>

<p>The form <code>defn</code> always compiles its innards, so the resulting code is
pretty zippy.  Note that when making a call to an alternate arity
version of the same function, we must use a regular function
invokation rather than <code>recur</code>.  We'd get a binding error otherwise.</p>

<p>Suppose we are using an association list to represent people in some
kind of database.  People have first and last names, but they might
not have a middle name, so both:</p>

<pre><code>'((:first-name "George") (:last-name "Washington"))
'((:first-name "Timofey") (:middle-name "Pavlovich") (:last-name
  "Pnin"))
</code></pre>

<p>are legitimate "persons" (neglecting that "Pavlovich" is a patronym
rather than a proper middle name).  How might we write a function to
extract the middle name succinctly?</p>

<pre><code>(defn extract-middle-name 
      [[:: middle :middle-name :or 
       (alist&gt;&gt;
        :middle-name :NMI)]]
     middle)

(extract-middle-name '((:first-name "Timofey") 
                       (:middle-name "Pavlovich") 
                       (:last-name "Pnin"))); -&gt; "Pavlovich"

(extract-middle-name '((:first-name "George") (:last-name
"Washington"))); -&gt; :NMI
</code></pre>

<p>(NMI stands for "No Middle Name")</p>

<p>The function <code>extract-middle-name</code> demonstrates the table
destructuring syntax and the use of an <code>:or</code> clause, which specifies
an alternative expression to destructuring the event that any
destructuring of the input fails.  It can be used to provide default
values for variables.  </p>

<p>Destructuring bind in Clojure provides one other feature which is
supported by this library.  Tables may use a short hand <code>:keys</code>
expression:</p>

<pre><code>(defn demo-keys [[:: :keys [a b c]]] (list a b c))
(demo-keys 
  (alist&gt;&gt; :a 'x :b 'y :c 'z))
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>(defn demo-keys-eqv [[:: a :a b :b c :c]] (list a b c))
</code></pre>

<p>That about covers it!</p>

<h3>If I'd Known Then What I Know Now</h3>

<p>This project is a little more than a year old, and in the intervening
time, I've learned a few new things which would have changed,
somewhat, the implementation.  For one, the more complete
understanding of the destructuring bind syntax which I developed while
creating this library would probably have informed a more elegant
implementation.  There are definite signs of gradual accretion in this
code.  A complete rewrite is on my todo list.</p>

<p>More concretely, I now recognize that parsing the binding expressions
is really a job for less ad-hoc parsing strategy.  Subsequent to this
project, I produced an implementation of monadic parser combinators
based on SMUG, for Common Lisp.  If I were to re-implement this
project now, I'd use a combinator approach for parsing.  For another
project I've written a Common-Lisp lambda list parser using parser
combinators, which is in <code>simplified-lambda-list-parser.el</code>. That
library should convey the style of what a more informed implementation
might look like (although CL-lambda lists are simpler than Clojure
destructuring forms).  See also <code>monad-parse.el</code> and <code>monads.el</code>,
which are my implementations of monadic operation and parsing, though
more closely based on previous work than this library.</p>

<p>The question of <code>recur</code> is separate, basically, from the destructuring
bind problem, and handling the two things together is responsible for
some of the mess of this implementation.  I've subsequently factored
out <code>recur</code> support into a separate library.  A rewrite would concern
itself mostly with destructuring bind, and use the <code>recur.el</code> library
to support self-recursion.  The implementation in <code>recur.el</code> is also a
little bit cleaner, and supports a better error checking model than
the one in this file.  I've included it, if the reader is interested.
There are also some stylistic differences - the codewalker dispatches
to a function for each form encountered rather than doing processing
in place, for instance.  This makes for a more readable
implementation.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you've found it interesting.</p>
